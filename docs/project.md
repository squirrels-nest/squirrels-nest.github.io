# About Squirrels Projects

## Project Structure

At the minimum, all Squirrels projects contain a [squirrels.yml] file for project configurations. In addition, a Squirrels project may also include the following resources:

|Resource|Git_Ignored|Description|
|:-------|:----------|:----------|
|[environcfg.yml](./topics/environcfg)|Y|Contains configuration specific to the server/environment, or environment variables that must not be shared|
|[models/](./topics/models-sql)|N|Folder for data models (as Jinja SQL or Python files)|
|pyconfigs/|N|Contains only Python files for configurations or functionality written in Python (other than Python models).|
|[sqrl_packages/](./cli/deps)|Y|Git projects used as package dependencies (downloaded with [sqrl deps](./cli/deps)) are stored here|
|target/|Y|All output files generated by Squirrels (such as compiled SQL files from [sqrl compile](./cli/compile)) are created here|

Within the `models/` and `pyconfigs/` folders, the Squirrels framework can also make use of the following resources in the project:

|Folder|Resource|Description|
|:-----|:-------|:----------|
|models|[dbviews/](./topics/models-sql)|Data models that run against an external database|
|models|[federates/](./topics/models-sql)|Data models that join together one or more other models using an embedded database|
|pyconfigs|[connections.py](./topics/database)|Specifies a set of database connections as SQLAlchemy engines that the project uses in Python. Only needed if not specified already in YAML in the [squirrels.yml] file|
|pyconfigs|[parameters.py](./topics/parameters)|Specifies a set of widget parameters (in Python) for datasets to use, typically used if the widget parameters are not specified in the [squirrels.yml] file (in YAML, which can be more verbose)|
|pyconfigs|[context.py](./topics/context)|Python script that processes real-time parameter selections into meaningful Python variables (or "context variables") that can be used by models|
|pyconfigs|[auth.py](./topics/auth)|Lets you create your own user model and method for authenticating against your source of users|

You may also add other folders/files in your Squirrels project that's not referenced directly by the framework, but may be referenced by existing Squirrels files. For instance, it is common to create a `macros` folder to store Jinja files used by data models written in Jinja SQL.
