# What's Next?

For an expanded version of the "weather example" project, see the "weather_analytics" folder in the "squirrels-examples" github repo found here:

https://github.com/squirrels-nest/squirrels-examples

It serves as a good example of sharing common SQL functionality across multiple datasets while allowing their parameter or query definitions to differ.

In addition, the following topic guides can be useful for certain Squirrels projects:
- [Authentication](../topics/auth)
- [Modify Dates with dateutils](../topics/modify-dates)
- [Versioning Best Practices](../tips/versioning)

You can also check out the [CLI References](/docs/category/cli-references) to understand the commands available with Squirrels, or check out the [Python APIs](/docs/category/python-apis) for all the Python methods available with the Squirrels library.
