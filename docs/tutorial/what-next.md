# What's Next?

For an expanded version of the "weather example" project, see this git repo here:

https://github.com/squirrels-nest/squirrels-weather-example

It serves as an example of how to share common SQL functionality across multiple datasets while allowing their parameter or query definitions to differ. You can also see the [Design for Commonality and Variability](../topics/common-vary) page on sharing Jinja macros and Python modules across models or projects.

In addition, the following topic guides can be useful for certain Squirrels projects:
- [Versioning Best Practices](../topics/versioning)
- [Authorization and Authentication](../topics/auth)
- [Modify Dates with dateutils](../topics/modify-dates)

You can also check out the [CLI References](/docs/category/cli-references) to understand the commands available with Squirrels, or check out the [Python APIs](/docs/category/python-apis) for all the Python methods available with the Squirrels library.
