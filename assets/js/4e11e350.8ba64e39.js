For many organizations, these executives must rely on others to get the information for them rather than being able to retrieve the information themselves (for instance, by clicking a button in a graphical user interface that calls the APIs), even when several of these data queries would take a similar shape but parameterized in different ways."}),"\n",(0,r.jsxs)(t.p,{children:['This is where Squirrels comes in handy.
